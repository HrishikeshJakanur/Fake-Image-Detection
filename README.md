# Fake Image Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting manipulated or fake images through machine learning techniques. The model analyzes patterns and inconsistencies to classify images as either **real** or **fake**.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling of a dataset with real and manipulated images.
- **Feature Extraction**: Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract image features.
- **Model Training**: Training the model to identify tampering through image inconsistencies.
- **Evaluation**: Measuring performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Applications**: Useful in journalism, social media, and cybersecurity to verify image authenticity.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, Scikit-learn
